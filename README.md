Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It involves creating a basic recipe website using only HTML. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate the following skills:

- Structuring content using semantic HTML elements.
- Linking different pages within a website.
- Using images and lists effectively in web development.
- Writing clean and readable HTML code.

This project serves as a foundational exercise to build essential web development skills.
