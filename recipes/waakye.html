    <p>Description</p>
    <p>Waakye is a dish originally from the Northern part of Ghana. It is a loose translation of the Hausa phrase rice and beans. Traditionally it is just white rice cooked with black eye peas and saltpetre/baking soda, which gives it a brownish colour. However, someone decided to add sorghum leaves along the way, and now everyone knows waakye to be a bright burgundy rice and beans dish.</p>

        <b>STEPS</b>
        <ol>
            <li>he first step is to soak the beans overnight. Soaking overnight shortens the cooking time but it also starts the breakdown process for the phytonutrients that make beans hard to digest</li>
            <li>The next day, the beans are washed and cooked with sorghum stems and baking soda. Once the beans are halfway cooked, add in more water, the rice and salt to taste</li>
            <li>Cover and cook till done</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes add the baking soda. if you are not using the stems, add about 1 tbsp of baking soda</li>
            <li>Let the beans cook for another 10 minutes. At this point, add in your rice, the rest of the water (2 1/4 cups) and mix evenly </li>
        </ol>
